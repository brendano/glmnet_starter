Some starter code for glmnet, collected from several different projects.

Every R file is a variant for a different project. 
`gn_sentiment`  should run out of the box.  The data is included.
`gn_geo` and `gn_finance` don't, however.  They are for viewing.

The writeup `finance_lasso_report.pdf` is most likely to be helpful to read.

The glmnet paper is:
